    title: "India walks back AI regulations",
    description:
      "India has recently revised its approach towards the regulation of artificial intelligence (AI), moving away from a plan that would have required tech firms to obtain government approval before launching or deploying AI models in the market. This decision comes after the initial advisory, issued on March 1, faced significant backlash from both local and international entrepreneurs and investors. The criticism led the Ministry of Electronics and IT to update the advisory, which now advises firms to label under-tested and unreliable AI models to inform users of their potential fallibility, rather than seeking prior government approval",

    title: "SpaceX 'dishonest' employees stock",
    description:
      "Leaked SpaceX documents have revealed that the company imposes strict conditions on its employees regarding the sale of their stock, particularly if the company deems that they have engaged in 'dishonest' behavior. According to a report by TechCrunch, SpaceX requires employees to agree to terms that could significantly impact their ability to sell vested shares. One notable provision allows SpaceX to repurchase vested shares within a six-month period and gives the company the right to ban past and present employees from participating in tender offers if they are deemed to have acted dishonestly, among other reasons. This policy means that if an employee is barred from selling stock in tender offers, they would have to wait until SpaceX goes public to realize any cash from their shares, a timeline that remains uncertain",

    title: "SBF may serve 50 years",
    description:
      "Federal prosecutors have recommended that Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, should be sentenced to 40 to 50 years in prison. This recommendation comes after Bankman-Fried was found guilty on all seven charges he faced, including fraud and conspiracy, for stealing $8 billion from customers1234. His sentencing is scheduled for March 28123. While the defense has argued for a much shorter sentence of 5.25 to 6.5 years, citing his lack of predatory intent and the possibility of FTX clients recovering most of their money, prosecutors have emphasized the need for a sentence that reflects the seriousness of the crimes and serves as a deterrent to others35. Despite the defense's appeal for leniency based on Bankman-Fried's philanthropy and remorse, the prosecution has highlighted the extensive harm caused to a large number of victims and the brazen disrespect for the rule of law",
